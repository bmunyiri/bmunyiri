She tells you how Hooks came to be part of the library, then walks you through how to install Create React App. Eve covers how you can use the useState Hook to handle different types of state variables and work with component trees. The useEffect Hook can be used for several application side effects, whenever the state of the app changes. Eve teaches you how to work with the dependency array effect and fetch data with the useEffect Hook. Next, she explains several additional Hooks and steps through the process of creating custom Hooks. In conclusion, Eve shows you some different directions you can pursue to improve your knowledge of the React ecosystem.</td>
